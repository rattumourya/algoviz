# **App Name**: AlgoViz Assist

## Core Features:

- LeetCode Problem Import: Input a LeetCode problem number to fetch problem details.
- Problem Understanding: Automatically understand the problem statement, constraints, and examples using AI tool.
- Hints Display: Display multiple hints to guide the user toward a solution.
- Solution Display: Provide a solution with clear explanations.
- Solution Visualization: Visually represent the solution's logic using interactive diagrams and animations. The best visualization method to use is chosen with an AI tool, to maximize clarity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 215, 60%, 50% (RGB hex: #4884D9) to evoke a sense of intelligence and clarity.
- Background color: HSL 215, 20%, 95% (RGB hex: #F0F4F9), a very light tint of the primary color, appropriate for a light scheme.
- Accent color: HSL 185, 50%, 50% (RGB hex: #40BFB2), a brighter color that stands out for key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, providing a clean, modern, and highly readable interface.
- Use clean and minimalist icons to represent different data structures and algorithmic steps.
- Incorporate subtle animations to illustrate the flow of algorithms and data transformations.
- Divide the screen into sections for problem statement, hints, solution, and visualization, ensuring each part is easily accessible and navigable.
